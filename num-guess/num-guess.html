===  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION ===
*Taken directly from the text on MDN:

I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number 
between 1 and 100, then challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each 
turn, the player should be told if they are right or wrong, and if they are wrong, whether 
the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what numbers they 
previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run 
out of turns. When the game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing 
again. -->
